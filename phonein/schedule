It was originally named in 2003 by Dan North as a response to Test Driven Development (TDD), and to Framework for Integrated Tests concepts, from the Customer Test practice in Extreme Programming. It has evolved over the last few years from a better way of doing TDD, through the inclusion of acceptance-test driven development (ATDD) to a full stack agile methodology. In this presentation we will explain how to do BDD and why its not about tools such as Specflow or Cucumber, but about approach. However, we&#39;ll give you a taste of those tools, once we have explained why you might need them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
