Then we’ll switch and look at Visual Studio 2012 and the options for building Windows Store apps whether you are a .NET, JavaScript or C++ developer. We’ll put together a simple example that touches all those technologies and we’ll even look at how we can combine them into a hybrid app. Along the way, we’ll wander into the Blend design tool and build up the whole picture of putting together WinRT apps.</p>"

Since the .NET Framework 1.0 the compiler has been written in unmanaged C++. With the release of Roslyn it is written in C#. This means it is simply an assembly of .NET types wrapped up in a Console Application. And heres the all-important part  the types are public. You can use the same types that the compiler uses in your own applications. You can compile code on the fly. Effectively you can turn any .NET language into a scripting language. This session shows a preview of what the support will look like in the .NET Framework 5.0 and focuses on practical examples focussed mainly on refactoring existing code.</BODY></p>\n"
