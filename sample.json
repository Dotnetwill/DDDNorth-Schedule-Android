				\"description\": \"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 15px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Behavior Driven Development (or BDD) is an Agile software development technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project. It was originally named in 2003 by Dan North as a response to Test Driven Development (TDD), and to Framework for Integrated Tests concepts, from the Customer Test practice in Extreme Programming. It has evolved over the last few years from a better way of doing TDD, through the inclusion of acceptance-test driven development (ATDD) to a full stack agile methodology. In this presentation we will explain how to do BDD and why its not about tools such as Specflow or Cucumber, but about approach. However, we&#39;ll give you a taste of those tools, once we have explained why you might need them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\"

				\"description\": \"&lt;p&gt;The Reactive Extensions for .NET library from Microsoft’s DevLabs provides an intriguing insight into how .NET in the future might deal with asynchronous or event-based programming. But, if you’ve taken a glance at Rx, it can sometimes feel as though Rx was invented by rocket scientists for rocket scientists. In this session, a non-rocket-scientist will walk through the basics of Rx from scratch, talking about what problem the framework is trying to solve, the simple interfaces that underpin its workings and looking at simple, common examples of where Rx might help in your development today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\"
